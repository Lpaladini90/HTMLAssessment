#### Description Overview

The purpose of this home work project was pretty simple.

We just learned the basics of HTML, and were given an example template of a basic html page that we were supposed to recreated.


### The structure

This basic page required us to use the tags we had just learned, and some that we had not to complete the page.

First what was required was the base html head and body to being.

With this, I started to fill out the body of the page. It began with 3 paragraphs, one being in italics, and all three needing to have the first word in bold.
To achieve this, I used <p>, strong and also em tags.

After the text, a table was required.
I wanted to build this table better than what was shown on the example so i used resources from w3school in order to put a border around it.

I used img tags and a href to add images and links to the sports teams pages.

Next came a form.

Inside the form we need used use a radio, check box, a submittal button. I like using the placeholder the best it felt like the cleanest way to ask for input from a customer.

###Tech I supposed

strong
em
